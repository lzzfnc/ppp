# Plugin Publish Public

This repo contains material for PPP, a working group focusing on plugins as a publishing surface. The plan is to develop and publish open source plugins. We hope to have a conversation through plugin development about: the closed and open source dichotomy, working with the materiality of software, and engaging with the users of that software as an audience or public.

Software hosts plugins to allow extended features that are not included in the main source code. Not every software is pluggable at the same level or in the same ways. Plugin developers are treated like guests, and adjust their etiquette. Sometimes it feels like a luxury resort, a couch at a friend's place, a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Plugin publishing is a way of touching software as a material, using UI and UX as a situated canvas to inform content. 

In the `examples` directory you can find boilerplate plugins to install for a range of different software, along with instruction to provide facilitation and help installing them. 

A workshop will be held at [AMRO 2024](https://www.radical-openness.org/en), check their website for more info! The main activity will be developing plugins. From something as simple as displaying a window with some text, to a more structured and playful interaction with the hosting software, participants will explore plugin publishing as a group.
