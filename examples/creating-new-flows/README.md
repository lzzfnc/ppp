Inkscape_extension_template
===========================
This plugin is based on https://github.com/Neon22/inkscape_extension_template An explicit inkscape template to be modified to make new extensions.

Making a new extension in inkscape requires a UI.
There are many fine extensions to use as examples but no single extension shows all the useful features.
This extension shows example parameters to cut and paste as well as a useful tab layout incorporating help.

Includes:

- differences between enums and optiongroups
- int, float
- color
- various forms of help text
- language conversion
etc.
